\chapter{Editor's Preface}
\label{ch:editor}

This book is Raymond Cottrell's paper \textit{The ``Sanctuary Doctrine''---Asset 
or Liability}, laid out to the design of Edward Tufte's books.  

The paper was first delivered to the second JIF symposium, November 2 through 
November 4, 2001, and again publicly on February 9, 2002 at the Association of 
Adventist Forums meeting in San Diego, California.

I did not have access to the original paper, but worked from digital copies
located at \url{http://www.rethinkingadventism.com/support-files/cottrell_1844.pdf}
and \url{http://www.truthorfables.com/Sanctuary_Cottrell.htm}.

This layout makes use of sidenotes located in the margin rather than footnotes.
I had to make several design decisions when converting the original paper's 
footnotes into sidenotes:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Where two or more large sidenotes appeared on a single page, causing one
    or more of the sidenotes to extend past the length of the page, I inserted page
    breaks in the body text, causing the offending sidenote(s) to appear on the
    new page.  I have tried to keep these page breaks inbetween paragraphs 
    throughout.
    \item Appendix chapter~\nameref{ch:shp} replaces footnote 131.
    \item For footnotes pointing to passages of scripture, I have tried to
    write out the corresponding passeges in full in the sidenote.  Exceptions
    to this are footnotes that refer to Leviticus 16, to Matthew 24 and 25,
    Daniel 2 and Daniel 7--12. I have included the complete chapters for each
    of these in the Appendix.
    \item Where one footnote was referenced in several places in the original,
    I opted to duplicate the footnote to sidenotes for each appearance, rather
    than have the sidenote refer to another sidenote.
\end{enumerate}

Footnote 37 said ``see note 26''. However, footnote 26 has nothing to do with 
the text for which footnote 37 was created.  I am unable to reconcile this
mismatch, so this document does not contain a sidenote for the original
footnote 37.



The majority of Cottrell's other papers referenced in this work are not
published.
