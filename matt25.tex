\chapter{Matthew 25:1-13}
\label{ch:matt25}

``Then the kingdom of heaven will be like this. Ten bridesmaids took their 
lamps and went to meet the bridegroom. 2 Five of them were foolish, and 
five were wise. 3 When the foolish took their lamps, they took no oil with them;
4 but the wise took flasks of oil with their lamps. 5 As the bridegroom was 
delayed, all of them became drowsy and slept. 6 But at midnight there was a 
shout, `Look! Here is the bridegroom! Come out to meet him.' 7 Then all those 
bridesmaids got up and trimmed their lamps. 8 The foolish said to the wise, 
`Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.' 9 But the wise replied,
`No! there will not be enough for you and for us; you had better go to the 
dealers and buy some for yourselves.' 10 And while they went to buy it, the 
bridegroom came, and those who were ready went with him into the wedding 
banquet; and the door was shut. 11 Later the other bridesmaids came also, 
saying, `Lord, lord, open to us.' 12 But he replied, `Truly I tell you, I do not
know you.' 13 Keep awake therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour.
